## Coursera Course Project - Getting and Cleaning Data

This is the Coursera course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does the following:

0. Download the data in the working directory, if it does not already exist.
1. Unzip data.
2. Read files and load data.
3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for.
   each measurement. 
5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.   
7. Creates a tidy data that have the average (mean) value of each
   variable for each subject and activity pair.

The final result is "tidy_data.txt" file.
